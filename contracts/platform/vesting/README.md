# PlatformVesting

A vesting contract with separate vesting pools for which you can set various parameters (set once during initialization, cannot be changed), whitelists (admin can delete and add users at any time) and liquidity (replenishment and withdrawal of liquidity is also carried out by the admin).

It is also possible to use funds that are not yet available for staking, however, for this, staking must be of a certain type.
